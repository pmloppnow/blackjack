# blackjack
A Python project that creates a simple GUI to play blackjack. 
The game is launched from the gui.py file. From this point, the player should type their bet amount and click play. Hands will be dealt to the dealer and the player
must choose to hit or stand. After a player stands or busts, a winner is declared and the bet is appropriately distributed. The player's total cash amount is saved at the end of each game. When finished click the exit button to close the window.
